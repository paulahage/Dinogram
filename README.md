Dinogram is a Social Media for dinosaurs inspired on Instagram.<br/>
I developed this project to put in practice my knowledge acquired so far with my studies and also to learn new skills.<br/>

The project was based on an Agile Methodology in collaboration with [@leonardiwagner](https://github.com/leonardiwagner), which played the role of a Project Manager/Senior Developer.
<br/>

The method consisted in: 
- plan and develop the issues in collaboration
- label each issue according to the time and difficulty of developing the task
- organize the issues on a Kanban board
- pick up an issue from the list 
- develop the issue following the guidelines
- commit all the workflow 
- open a pull request to be reviewed by [@leonardiwagner](https://github.com/leonardiwagner)
- after approval choose another issue and repeat the process
